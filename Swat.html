        <p>Next on the list of places in Swat Valley is the Kumrat Valley, which is almost 9 hours from Islamabad and
            can be <br> reached one hour from Swat. Kumrat Valley falls in the Upper Dir District, just opposite the Gabral,
            and offers <br> some unique locations. Above all, streams and waterfalls are abundant here. The ideal place for
            base camping, but <br> if you are not comfortable with camping, there are some resorts and hotels after 3 hours
            of trekking down the town.</p>

        <p>One of the most popular hill stations of Swat is Madyan. The hill station is preferable for tourists because
            of the <br> Swat River and its surrounding. When someone visits the Madyan for the first time, they love the
            pleasant weather <br> and panoramic views.

            Furthermore, tourists also love to visit Madyan because of its delicious mouthwatering trout <br> fish and
            fantastic weather, even in the hot summer</p>

        <p>Mahudand Lake is also a must-visit place in Swat valley. The glacial alpine lake is located in the Usho
            Valley of <br> Kalam. The richly green meadows encircled the lake at an elevation of 9,603 ft. the immense Hindu
            Kush peaks <br> provide a complete backdrop with green fields for the tourist to camp. The best time to visit the
            lake is in <br> midsummer because the lake is frozen in winter and inaccessible due to road blockage. Above all,
            you will find <br> different species of flora and fauna with enormous fishes. No doubt, the best place for
            allocating a whole day.</p>
