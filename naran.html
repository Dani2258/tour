        <p>Anso Lake is another lake at some distance from Lake Saif ul Mulook because it is shaped like a tear. This
            lake is <br> situated at an altitude of 13,928 feet above sea level. Ansoo Jheel (Lake) is considered to be the
            highest lake in the <br> Himalayan mountain range. The journey from Saif al-Muluk to Lake Anso is 10 km which you
            have to complete <br> with a walk, which can take up to 4-5 hours. That's why, we would suggest that if you want
            to go to Lake Ansu, <br> you can start your journey from Naran to Saif Al-Muluk Lake in the morning.

        <p>Siri Paye is green carpeted land, covered under clouds and mesmerizing scenery of snowy mountains. On your <br>
            tour to Shogran, must visit Siri Paye Meadows and Siri Lake. Road condition from Shogran to Siri Paye is not <br>
            too good but this place is worth seeing.</p>
